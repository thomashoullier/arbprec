# Arbitrary Precision (Core)
`arbprec` is a lower-level API for arbitrary precision arithmetic.
It can be used as the basis for constructing representation and arithmetic
on arbitrary precision unsigned integers (and from there many other things).

We are concerned here with the manipulation of vectors of words (bytes).
